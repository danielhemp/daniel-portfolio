        After being in the Non-Profit sector for 8 years I decided that it was time for a change. I have always had a passion for technology and love staying up to date with new ideas and concepts. So I decided to become a IT Support Technician as a step in the direction of becoming an IT professional.

        I am working with several small companies and have worked on updating, modifying, implementing new web technologies. This has included working with PIM's, CMS's and other web tools for small and medium sized businesses. I like working with these types of projects so much I would like to make it a full time career. I firmly believe that if a business doesn't have a web presence it will not be able to last very long in the global economy that we now occupy.

        I have often been called a "True Boy Scout" as I am hard coded to be truthful and hard working. But the other side of this personality is that my family is a huge part of my life. Whether that is being the Committee Chairmen of my children's Cub Scout Pack, or just spending the night at home playing games with my whole family, there is nothing better than doing a hard days works.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
