       I have been working with several small companies and have worked on updating, modifying, implimenting new web technologies. This has included working with PIM's, CMS's and webtools for small and medium sized businesses. I liked working with these types of projects so much I would like to make it a full time career. I firmly believe that if a business doesn't have a web presence it will not be able to last very long in the global ecomony that we now occupy. The Web is the Future.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
