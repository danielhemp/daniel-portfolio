### A True "Boy Scout"

As a joke my friends growing up and, and to this day, call me a "True Boy Scout". I always put others first, do my best whenever I can, and I am always looking for ways to make the world better. It does help that I am an Eagle Scout, and actually worked as a Professional Scouter for eight years. 

### Technology is Key

I have been working with PC's all my life and I have loved keeping up to date with as much technology as possible. I believe that technology is a force for growth, and development. If there is a way to give people more time to enjoy life through technology then we should work towards it. 

### Growth Mindset

Never Stop Learning! This is my every day. If you haven't learned something new today, what have you accomplished? This how my mind works. I don't want a day to go by that I haven't learned something new, or at least built upon a skillset.

### Getting Things Done

With my eight years as a Scouting Professional, I was always looking and implementing ways to get a certain job done with the best results, for the people I was serving. It wasn't always easy, but the results were there. I do my best not to leave things half done.
