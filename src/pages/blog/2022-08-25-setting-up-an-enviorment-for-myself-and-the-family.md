So if you know me, you know that I am all about getting into new technology, or making use of the technology that I/we already have. One of the ones I have been diving a bit into recently is Docker.

For those of you that don't know what Docker is it is a way of containerizing applications. It is similar to virtualization, in that you can have multiple services running on the same device at the same time. The main difference is the use of resources. Containers use ***way*** less RAM and storage then having to create a separate virtual machine every time. 

The Containers that I have set up so far are pretty simple, but they will continue to be added to over time, and hopefully I will be able to share even more about my experiences. 



The Ones I have set up so far are 

*   ![Portainer]()

  Portainer: to manage all of the other containers
* Code-Server: to write my own code, and have access everywhere
* Heimdall: a quick personal home-page for all of my internet usage.
