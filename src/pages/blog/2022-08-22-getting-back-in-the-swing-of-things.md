##### *Today was a good day at home with the kids, and it made me realize that I can have many more weekends like this.*

To get things this way though I will need to get a bit more income coming in the door. While my wife is working on doing something so we don't have to solely rely on my income, I want to make more, and get more benefits.

##### *So to do this, I need a better portfolio, and a regular addition to my github portfolio.*

## ***So today marks the first day of my 100 days of code challenge!***

Today's code! Rock-Paper-Scissors in Javascript! It didn't take me very long, and will definitely get optimized later, but you can check out the code on github. If I can get my projects hosted on a separate page, I will add them here.
