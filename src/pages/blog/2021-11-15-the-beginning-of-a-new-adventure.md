I have recently finished a course in web development, and I loved a lot of the things that I have learned. While I was completing the course, I found a new job, and have begun working in the IT field with a relative with his business.

I am loving the things that I am doing, and I have found that I now have a little bit of time to have hobbies! That is a huge change for me. I didn't really realize that I didn't actually have any hobbies for YEARS. This is just the beginning of my journey. I will be adding more, adding to this website, and launching a range of NFTs for people to look at and purchase if they would like to support my journey.
